/**
 * 
 * Game Element Mine
 * <p>
 * This class is a subclass of Game Items.
 * It has the ID 4 as well as a special impact.
 * If the player hits a Mine on the shootingArea,
 * he or she will "die" and the game 
 * will be quit immediately. The other player will have won 
 * the game. 
 * But before we can implement this, the impact of the GameElement will
 * be MinusPoints.
 *
 * <p>
 * Island uses in his constructor {@link #Mine}
 * the constructor {@link #AGameItems} to set the ID.
 * Use {@link #mineImpact} to get the impact of the island.
