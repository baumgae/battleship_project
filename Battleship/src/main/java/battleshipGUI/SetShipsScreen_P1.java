 * SetShips Screen 
 * <p>
 * This is the GUI, if a user starts a new game.
 * After he has chosen the mode as well as the difficulty, he'll get a 
 * "dementsprechende" game area where he is able to set his different ships
 * on special coordinates.
 * <p>
 * 
 * First, the user has to set his name.
 * Below he can see the different ships which are offered to him.
 * Trough clicking on a ship and after that directly
 * on a coordinate, he will be able to set the ships.
 * Through clicking on a ship two times, the user is able to change 
 * the direction of a ship.
