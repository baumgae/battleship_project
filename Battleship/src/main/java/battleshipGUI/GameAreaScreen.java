/**
 * GameArea Screen
 * <p>
 * This is the GUI while a user or two users are playing the game.
 * Each player has got his own game area with two different <br>
 * coordinate fields on them. One's the shooting area while the other one
 * is the ship area.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Over here the user is able to chose a coordinate on which he wants to shoot.
 * If he has shot on a coordinate, the image will change. Whether he has
 * hit a ship, water or a gameItem, the image will change accordingly.
 * He is also able to see how many times he has hit the shooting area in general and
 * how many points he got as well as them from his enemy.
