 * The Method {@link #setDifficulty} will be called, if the player sets the
 * difficulty of a new game. Over here the number of game Elements will be
 * given. The Method {@link #getFieldSize(EDifficulty)} is for the
 * GameAreaFactory so it will get the MaxX and MaxY Values. The GameArea will be
 * as big as it will be chosen.
