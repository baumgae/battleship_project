/**
 * DifficultyManager for setting the size of the GameArea
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is managing the different possible sizes of the Game Area due to
 * the setting of the Difficulty of the game.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Method {@link #getFieldSize(EDifficulty)} is for the
 * GameAreaFactory so it will get the MaxX and MaxY Values. The GameArea will be
 * as big as it will be chosen.
 * {@link #getNumberOfDolphins(EDifficulty)} returns the number of dolphins depending on the chosen difficulty. <br>
 * {@link #getNumberOfIslands(EDifficulty)} returns the number of islands depending on the chosen difficulty. <br>
 * {@link #getNumberOfLuckyDwarfs(EDifficulty)} returns the number of lucky dwarfs depending on the chosen difficulty. <br>
 * {@link #getNumberOfMines(EDifficulty)} returns the number of mines depending on the chosen difficulty. <br>
 * {@link #getNumberOfOneFieldBoats(EDifficulty)} returns the number of one field boats depending on the chosen difficulty. <br>
