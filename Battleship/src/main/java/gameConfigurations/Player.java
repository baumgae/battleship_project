/**
 * Abstract Class for Player
 * <p>
 * This is the abstract class for Players.
 * If a new Game Area will be created, 
 * two Players per Game will be created too. <br>
 * This should be somehow the layer between Logic and UI.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Subclasses use constructor {@link #Player} to set name, points and hits.<br>
 * Use {@link #countPoints} to count on the Points, when something is shot on the GameArea.<br>
 * Use {@link #getCountedPoints} to get the counted points of a player.<br>
 * Use {@link #countHits} to count on the hits, when the player shots.<br>
 * Use {@link #getCountedHits} to get the counted hits of a player.
